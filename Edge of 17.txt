Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singin'
"Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singin'
"Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh"

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend (everything's not)
"Baby, nothin' else mattered"
